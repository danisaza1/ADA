    <ul>
      <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is not closed properly,
	  then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend</li>

	    for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong</strong> <em>emphasised?</em>
	    what is this? </li>
	  <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's
	    look at an example: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/"> link to Mozilla homepage </a> </li>

      href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri+with_options"> tools </a></li>
    </ul>
